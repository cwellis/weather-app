Location Based Weather App

Here, users can see their local weather forecast using WeatherAPI.

How It's Made: Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

This is my first fullstack application I created using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It takes the users location using their browser, and utilizes WeatherAPIs location based services to give a week long forecast.

Optimizations: 
I wouuld like for users to be able to look up other locations instead of being locked to only their local region.

Lessons Learned:
This project kickstarted my love for software engineering. Being able to make the connections and deploy an app that is fully functional only increased my desire to learn more.
